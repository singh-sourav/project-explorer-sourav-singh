Run the follwowing commands :

1) npm install : "Installs all the npm dependencies like redux and redux thunk"
2) npm start : "Runs the app"



Note : CORS policy check is blocking my browser. I have implemented dummy flow too which adds the dummy data if CORS related error is there just for checking of features like "Search projects".
